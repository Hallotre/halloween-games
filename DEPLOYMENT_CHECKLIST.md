- [ ] `.env.local` NOT included in repository

### 2. Import to Vercel
- [ ] Vercel account created
- [ ] Project imported from GitHub
- [ ] Framework preset: Next.js (auto-detected)
- [ ] Build command: `npm run build` (default)
- [ ] Output directory: `.next` (default)

### 3. Environment Variables
Add these in Vercel project settings â†’ Environment Variables:

- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` = `https://your-app.vercel.app` (update after first deploy)
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` = (same as local)
- [ ] `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` = (same as local)
- [ ] `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` = (same as local)

- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = (same as local)
- [ ] `STEAM_API_KEY` = (optional, same as local)
- [ ] `STREAMER_TWITCH_ID` = (same as local)

**Important**: Make sure to set these for "Production", "Preview", and "Development" environments!

### 4. First Deployment
- [ ] Click "Deploy"
- [ ] Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)
- [ ] Copy your Vercel URL (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`)

### 5. Update Twitch OAuth
- [ ] Go to Twitch Developer Console
- [ ] Edit your application
- [ ] Add production callback URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/twitch`
- [ ] Save changes

### 6. Update Vercel Environment

- [ ] Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your actual Vercel URL
- [ ] Redeploy the project (Deployments â†’ ... â†’ Redeploy)

### 7. Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] Visit your production URL
- [ ] Sign in with Twitch works
- [ ] Can suggest games
- [ ] Can vote on games
- [ ] Real-time updates work
- [ ] Streamer controls work (if applicable)
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Test in different browsers

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use your own domain:

### 1. Add Domain in Vercel
- [ ] Go to project settings â†’ Domains
- [ ] Add your custom domain
- [ ] Follow DNS configuration instructions

### 2. Update Configurations
- [ ] Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` in Vercel to your custom domain
- [ ] Add custom domain callback to Twitch OAuth:

- [ ] Redeploy

### 3. Test Custom Domain
- [ ] Visit your custom domain
- [ ] Test all features again
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate is active (https)

## Troubleshooting Production Issues

### Build Fails
- Check Vercel build logs for errors
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Try building locally: `npm run build`

### Authentication Not Working
- Verify `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your actual URL
- Check Twitch callback URLs are correct
- Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify Supabase URL and key are correct
- Check Supabase project is not paused
- Review Supabase logs for errors

### Real-time Not Working
- Verify real-time is enabled in Supabase
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Ensure RLS policies allow reading

### Streamer Controls Not Showing
- Verify `STREAMER_TWITCH_ID` is set correctly
- Check browser console for API errors
- Sign out and sign back in

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

- [ ] Vercel Analytics (if enabled)
- [ ] Supabase Dashboard â†’ Database â†’ Tables (check data)
- [ ] Supabase Dashboard â†’ Logs (check for errors)
- [ ] Browser console on production site
- [ ] User feedback

## Maintenance

Regular tasks:

- [ ] Monitor Supabase free tier limits (500MB database)
- [ ] Monitor Vercel free tier limits (100GB bandwidth)
- [ ] Check for Next.js updates
- [ ] Update dependencies periodically: `npm update`
- [ ] Review and moderate suggested games
- [ ] Clear old/played games if needed

## Security Notes

- âœ… Never commit `.env.local` to Git
- âœ… Never share your `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- âœ… Never share your Twitch Client Secret
- âœ… Never share your Supabase service role key (we only use anon key)
- âœ… Keep your dependencies updated for security patches
- âœ… Monitor Supabase logs for suspicious activity
