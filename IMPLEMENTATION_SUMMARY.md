### 3. NextAuth.js for Authentication
**Why**: Industry standard, easy Twitch integration, session management built-in.

### 4. Tailwind CSS for Styling
**Why**: Rapid development, consistent design, small bundle size, responsive utilities.

### 5. TypeScript
**Why**: Type safety, better IDE support, catch errors at compile time, self-documenting code.

### 6. Server-Side API Routes
**Why**: Secure authentication checks, protect sensitive operations, better performance.

### 7. Real-time Subscriptions
**Why**: Better UX, no polling needed, instant updates, lower server load.
